The spatial database has to be created in the beginning of the project, using the functions 'Building the spatial database - Step 1-'
(complete all the steps 1 to 4)

The other steps can only be applied after that, for each participant.
They have to be completed in a row:
-first, 'Step 1 - Process EDA, accelerometer and skin temperature data',
-then 'Step 2 - Collect and process data from strava--HR, speed, altitude data',
-then'Step 3 - Physiological, movement and contextual data fusion'.
